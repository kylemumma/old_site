            Python is a cross-platform, object-oriented programming language. It contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core Python can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional packages; for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Requests library allows you to simply and effectively send HTTP requests with Python</li>
          <li>The BeautifulSoup library allows you to easily parse through HTML code making webscraping much simpler</li>
          <li>The Pillow library is a user friendly Python imaging library that allows you to easily work with images in Python</li>
          <li>The NumPy adds some very advanced math functionalities to Python</li>
          <li>The matplotlib library is an advanced numerical plotting library for Python, very useful for data science and data analysis</li>
        </ul>

          <h2>What you should already know</h2>

        <p>This guide assumes you have no previous knowledge besides a fluency with computers and the internet.</p>

          <h2>Hello World</h2>
        </header>

        <p>To get started with writing Python, open IDLE and write your first "Hello world" Python code:</p>
  <code>def hello_world():
    print("Hello World!")

  hello_world()
  </code>
        <p>Run the code and watch it unfold in the terminal!</p>

          <h2>Variables</h2>
        </header>

        <p>
          You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Python identifier must start with a letter or underscore (_) Subsequent characters can be letters, underscores, or numbers (0-9). Because Python is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase). There are some reserved words which you cannot use as a variable name because Python uses them for other things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some examples of legal names are _hits, temp99, name_of_something, and _name_name_name.
        </p>

          <h2>Declaring Variables</h2>
        </header>

        <p>The assignment statement creates new variables and gives them values. Basic assignment statement in Python is:</p>
  <code>variable = value</code>
        <p>Where the equal sign (=) is used to assign value (right side) to a variable name (left side). See the following statements:</p>
  <code>item_name = "computer"
  item_qty = 10
  item_value = 1000.23
  is_item_broken = false
  </code>
      </section>

      <section id="variable_scope" class="main-section">
        <header>
          <h2>Variable Scope</h2>
        </header>

        <p>
          When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.
        </p>
        <p>The following would work correctly when run:</p>
  <code>def add_numbers():
    x = 10
    y = 10

    print(x + y)
  </code>
        <p>Because all the variables are within scope. The next example however would not run correctly because the varibles x and y are out of scope.</p>
  <code>def numbers():
    x = 10
    y = 10

  print(x + y)
  </code>
        <p>Since x and y were declared within the function, that function is the only thing that has access to them. When we try to reference the variables outside of the function, it doesn't work.</p>
